<h2>Life History of Shivaji Maharaj</h2>
<p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha kingdom of India. The security of the kingdom was entirely based on religious tolerance and also on the functional integration of Brahmans, Marathas, and the Prabhus.</P>
<p>Shivaji who was the descendent of a line of prominent nobles was very brave and fount many wars to consolidate India. At that time, India was under the Muslim rulers and divided. The Mughals were in north India and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur as well as of Golconda in the south of India. 
</p>
<p>The ancestral estates of Shivaji Maharaj were situated in the Deccan region in the realm of Bijapur sultans. He found the suppression of the Muslim rulers and the persecution of all the Hindus in the region. He was sad due to the devastating condition of the Hindus that by the age of 16 he convinced himself to be the cause of the Hindu’s freedom. It was a conviction that was to sustain him throughout his whole life.
</p>

<h2>Conquests of Shivaji</h2>  
<p>With this motive, Shivaji began to seize the weaker Bijapur outposts along with his band of followers. In this process, he ruined a few of his very influential coreligionists. They had aligned themselves with the sultans. His daring military skills and also his sternness towards the oppression of the Hindus had him win many battles and administration. His depredations grew very audacious and various minor expeditions sent to chastise him always proved to be ineffective.
</p>
<p>In the year 1659, when the sultan of Bijapur sent an army of around 20 thousand soldiers under the leadership of Afzal Khan to defeat him, Shivaji Maharaj intelligently defeated Afzal Khan. He pretended to be intimidated and enticed the force deep into the difficult mountain terrains and then killed Afzal Khan at a meeting to which he had lured hum by all submissive appeals. 
</p>
<p>For the time being, the handpicked troops that have been previously positioned swooped down on the unwary Bijapur army and routed it. Overnight, Shivaji Maharaj became a daunting warlord with the possession of horses, the guns, as well as the ammunitions of the Bijapur army.
</p>
<p>Alarmed by the rising strength of Shivaji, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb ordered his viceroy of the south to march against him. Shivaji encountered himself by carrying out a very daring and brave raid right within the encampment of the viceroy. In this raid, he lost the fingers of his one hand and also his son. 
</p>
<p>Embarrassed by this reverse, the viceroy withdrew his force. After this incident, Shivaji was thought to provoke the Mughals. He attacked the rich coastal town of Surat and took immense booty.  Aurangzeb disappointed and raged by this incident could hardly ignore the loss and to avenge Shivaji he sent out his most prominent general, Mirza Raja Jai Singh. Mirza Raja was sent along with 100 thousand men. 
</p>
<p>The pressure that was exerted by this vast force which was also combined with the drive and tenacity of Jai Singh very soon compelled Shivaji Maharaj to call for peace. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj undertook that he and his son will attend the court of Aurangzeb at Agra to be formally accepted as Mughal vassals. In Agra, hundreds and thousands of miles from their homeland, Shivaji and his son both were placed under house arrest. During the house arrest, they lived under the threat of execution.
</p>
<p>Fearlessly, Shivaji feigned illness, and therefore as atonement, he began to send out enormous baskets filled with delicious sweets that were to be distributed among the poor. In the year 1666 of 17 August, he and his son had themselves carried past their guards in these baskets. His escape was the most thrilling and daring episode filled with very high drama which was about to change the course of Indian history. 
</p>
<p>His devoted followers welcomed him back as their great leader and in the coming two years from this escape he achieved many wars. He not only conquered and won back the lost territories but also had expanded his domain. He collected tribute from the Mughal regions and also raided their rich cities. He also reorganized the army as well as instituted reforms for the welfare of his subjects. 
</p>
<p>Taking lessons from all the English traders as well as from the Portuguese traders who had already gained toeholds in India, he began to build a naval force. He was the very first Indian ruler of his time to use sea power for trade and also for the defense of his region.
</P>
<P>Almost as though jabbed by Shivaji’s meteoric rise in power, Aurangzeb intensified his genocide and persecutions of Hindus. Aurangzeb also imposed a poll tax on them, connived at forcible conversions, and also demolished temples, and erecting mosques in their places.

<h2>Independent Sovereign (Purna Swaraj)</h2>
<p>In 1674 during the summer, Shivaji Maharaj had himself enthroned with great fanfare as an independent sovereign. The entire suppressed Hindu majority rallied to him as their great leaders. He ruled his domain for almost six years through a cabinet of eight ministers. Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj who devout Hindu, who prided himself as the protector of his religion, broke the tradition by commanding that two of his relatives who had been forcibly converted to Islam should be taken back to Hinduism. 
</p>
<p>Even though both the Christians, as well as the Muslims, often kept on imposing their creeds on the population by force, he respected the beliefs and protected the religious places of both communities. Along with Hindus, many Muslims were also in his service. After his coronation, his most remarkable campaign was in the south. During this campaign, he allied with the Sultans and blocked the grand design of the Mughals to spread their rule over the entire subcontinent.

<h2>Spouses and Children of Shivaji Maharaj</h2>
<p>Shivaji Maharaj had several wives and two sons. His elder son at one stage defeated the Mughals and was brought back with the utmost difficulty.  Many are unaware of the fact that Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj has eight wives. His first wife was Saibai also known as Nimbalkar. 
</p>
<p>The names of the other wives were Soyarabai, Mohite, Putalabai, Palkar, Sakvarbi Gaikwad, Sangunabai, and Kashibai Jadhav. His first wife Saibai bore him Sambhaji and three daughters. Soyarabai bore him a son named Rajaram and a daughter whose name was Deepabai. His other children were Rajkunvarbai from his wife Sagunabai and also Kamlabai from Sakvarbai. In the year 1659, his first wife Saibai passed away at a very young age due to a prolonged illness.
